# website_blocker
Simple python application that reads and writes to the host file on a computer to block websites at specific hours of the days. Users can provide a list of websites they would like to be blocked as well as during what timeframe they would like the sites to be blocked at. The application first checks the host files for whether the websites listed are already blocked and if not, redirects them to 127.0.0.1 when accessed durng the times of the day which the user wants blocked. The script can be scheduled and run 24/7 on a python server. This application can allow users to block specific webpages during working hours to improve productivity and concentration on tasks.
